# The Festival_ theme

We created a design and templates for a microsite/campaign page that can be easily adapted. In our case, the template showcases a festival event page. In our existing AEM projects we have seen that for campaigns or events, clients have used other content management systems to host such microsites. Therefore, we used this challenge to set up an easily reusable template that would allow our clients to host these microsites within AEM directly as realization time is short.
Next to a homepage, a news page, detail page and content page we also included a dark mode content page. We heavily used style policies to make best use of the AEM core components.
We have learned through this challenge that style policies are very powerful and that we can get pretty far without backend development. Furthermore, the collaboration between business/content team and frontend developers was intuitive and fast, making the lives of both disciplines easier.
